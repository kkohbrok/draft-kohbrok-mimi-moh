1.  Introduction

   This document describes an HTTP-based transport layer protocol for
   use with all MIMI sub-protocols.  The MIMI transport protocol
   provides an envelope for for MIMI transaction types and takes care of
   message authentication.

   This document also describes the endpoints that are served by the
   individual MIMI functionalities.

2.  Authentication

   The MIMI transport protocol uses the mutually authenticated mode of
   TLS to provide authentication for server-to-server communication.

   TODO: More information specific to how TLS should be used, i.e.
   mandate best practices that make sense in a mutually authenticated
   scenario that involves two WebPKI based certificates.

3.  Framing

   The MIMI transport protocol uses a simple framing structure that
   includes the transaction payload, as well as a small header that
   signals the protocol version, as well as the transaction type
   contained in the envelope.

   enum {
       reserved(0),
       mimi10(1),
       (65535)
   } ProtocolVersion;

   // See the "MIMI Transaction Types" IANA registry for values
   // e.g. "mimi.delivery-service.add"
   opaque TransactionType;

   struct {
     ProtocolVersion version = mimi10;
     TransactionType transaction_type;
     opaque serialized_transaction<V>;
   } TransactionEnvelope;

4.  Endpoint Discovery

   A messaging provider that wants to query the endpoint of another
   messaging provider first has to discover the fully qualified domain
   name under which Delivery Service of that provider can be reached.
   It does so by performing a GET request to provider.com/.well-
   known/mimi/ds-domain. provider.com could for example answer by
   providing the domain ds.provider.com (assuming that this is where it
   responds to the REST endpoints defined below).

5.  REST Endpoints

   The following REST endpoints can then be used to access the different
   functionalities of the Delivery Service.

   As the Delivery Service relies on TLS encoded structs, all requests
   to endpoints described below should be marked as Content-type:
   application/octet-stream.

   All structs and concepts referred to below are defined in draft-
   robert-mimi-delivery-service, where their underlying functionality is
   defined in more detail.

5.1.  Process Group Message

   POST /group_operation
   Content-type: application/octet-stream

   Body
   TLS serialized DSRequest

   Response
   TLS serialized DSResponse

   This REST endpoint provides access to all operations associated with
   an existing MLS group on the Delivery Service such as delivering
   application messages, adding group members, removing group members,
   updating key material, etc.  The payloads for this endpoint are
   generally provided (and signed) by a member of the corresponding
   group rather than the service provider of that member.  The exact
   operation, as well as the target group ID is determined by the
   payload itself rather than an HTTP header, the path or any other
   query parameter.

5.2.  Welcome Information

   GET /welcome_information
   Content-type: application/octet-stream

   Body
   TLS serialized DSRequest

   Response
   TLS serialized DSResponse

   Through this endpoint, a provider can obtain information required to
   join the group for clients that have already received a Welcome
   message.  The DS responds with the group’s RatchetTree, as well as
   authentication information of existing group members.

5.3.  External Commit Information

   GET /external_commit_information
   Content-type: application/octet-stream

   Body
   TLS serialized DSRequest

   Response
   TLS serialized DSResponse

   Guest providers can use this endpoint to obtain information that
   allows a client to join a group without a Welcome message from an
   existing group member.

5.4.  Verification Key

   GET /verification_key
   Content-type: application/octet-stream

   Body
   TLS serialized VerificationKeyRequest

   Response
   TLS serialized VerificationKeyResponse

   This allows guest providers to obtain the verification key of this
   provider.  This allows other providers to authenticate queries
   originating from this provider.

5.5.  Deliver Connection Request

   POST /connection_request
   Content-type: application/octet-stream

   Body
   TLS serialized QueueingServiceRequest

   Response
   TLS serialized QueueingServiceResponse

   This endpoint lets other providers deliver connection establishment
   request to clients of this provider.

5.6.  Deliver Message

   POST /deliver_message
   Content-type: application/octet-stream

   Body
   TLS serialized QueueingServiceRequest

   Response
   TLS serialized QueueingServiceResponse

   An owning provider can deliver messages from one of its owned groups
   to this endpoint, if one of the group’s clients is associated with
   this provider.

5.7.  Connection KeyPackage Retrieval

   POST /connection_key_packages
   Content-type: application/octet-stream

   Body
   TLS serialized ConnectionKeyPackageRequest

   Response
   TLS serialized ConnectionKeyPackageResponse

   Allows another provider to retrieve KeyPackages for use during the
   connection establishment process between two users.

5.8.  Group KeyPackage Retrieval

   POST /group_key_packages
   Content-type: application/octet-stream

   Body
   TLS serialized GroupKeyPackageRequest

   Response
   TLS serialized GroupKeyPackageResponse

   Allows another provider to retrieve KeyPackages that can be used to
   add another user or one of its clients to an existing group.

6.  Rate-limiting

   The MIMI transport protocol itself doesn’t include any rate-limiting
   measures.  However, traditional rate-limiting (e.g. based on sender
   IP) can be applied, as well as rate-limiting based on information in
   the message body such as Group ID (e.g. in the case of the
   /welcome_information endpoint) or group member (in the case of the
   /group_operation endpoint).  More fine-grained rate-limiting can be
   applied through the use of the emerging Privacy Pass protocol (draft-
   ietf-privacypass-auth-scheme).

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has created the following registries: * Transaction Types

7.1.  Transaction Types

   An transaction type denotes the nature of a given payload in the
   context of the MIMI protocol.  The transaction type is a string that
   is composed of substrings separated by dots.

   The first substring is "mimi", followed by the document that defines
   the corresponding transaction payload, which in turn is followed by
   the name of the transaction.  The MIMI transaction specified in the
   MIMI DS document that signals the addition of a client would for
   example be denoted by the string ~~~ "mimi.delivery-service.add" ~~~
